You are an IC verification engineer and you need to use UVM to build a tesebench.

### **{modulename}_add_toggle_code_seq.sv Generation Specification**


1. File naming: The file name should be `{modulename}_add_toggle_code_seq.sv`, where `{modulename}` is the name of the dut module, please replace all {modulename} with  names when generating files and content;

2. Input file definitions:
   - `spec` (in `.md` format): Describes the design specifications of the module under test.
   - `dut`: The code being tested.
   - `{modulename}_seq_item.sv`: Defines the transaction and related constraints.
   - `{modulename}_seq.sv`: The original stimulus.
   - `input_signal.txt`: Lists the signals in the transaction that can be randomized.
   - `toggle_coverage.txt`: Contains signals and registers that did not undergo 0->1 and 1->0 transitions during simulation with the original stimulus.
   - `seq_class_name.txt`: The class names already present in the original stimulus are not allowed to be used again in this file;

3. Coverage Analysis & Stimulus Generation  
   - Analyze `toggle_coverage.txt` using:  
     * Design specification  
     * dut implementation  
     * Transaction constraints  
   - Generate new stimuli targeting untoggled signals  
   - New stimuli must complement original sequences  

4. Signal handling restrictions:
   - New stimuli may only operate on signals listed in `input_signal.txt`
   - Perform new randomization/assignment (with different values from original)
   - Strictly prohibit operations on signals not in `input_signal.txt`
   - (Even if mentioned in `toggle_coverage.txt`)

5. Base requirements for new stimuli:
   - Maintain identical class structure with `{modulename}_seq.sv`
   - Comply with UVM sequence component architecture
   - All assignments must respect constraints in `{modulename}_seq_item.sv`

6. Naming convention:
   - New class names must not appear in `seq_class_name.txt`
   - Use distinct names to avoid duplication errors

7. Randomization constraints:
   - Within randomize() with {} blocks:
     * Prohibited: $urandom, $urandom_range
     * Prohibited: if...else blocks
     * Prohibited: begin...end blocks
   - (These cause syntax errors)

8. **Toggle Coverage Improvement**  
   - New stimuli shall:  
     * Trigger 0->1 and 1->0 transitions for signals in `toggle_coverage.txt`  
     * Improve toggle coverage metrics  
   - **Critical**:  
     * Never directly assign to target signals/registers  
     * Strictly follow Requirement 4  

9. Code scope limitation:
   - Only sequence-related code required
   - Exclude:
     * Sequence sending mechanisms
     * seq_item related code

10. Code quality requirements:
    - Ensure all signal assignments comply with `{modulename}_seq_item.sv` constraints
    - Provide clear comments for key configuration points
    - Full compliance with UVM 1.2 standard
    - Zero syntax errors

*Note:
- Check that all {modulename} in the generated code have been replaced with the actual module name.
