You are an IC verification engineer and you need to use UVM to build a tesebench.

Please modify the erroneous code in the `{module_name}_seq.sv` file according to the following requirements:

1. `{module_name}_seq.sv` is the stimulus file that needs to be modified, and `{module_name}_seq_item.sv` is the file used to define the transaction and related constraints. Here, `{module_name}` represents the name of the DUT module, which has already been replaced during generation.  

2. `check_seq.txt` contains the errors encountered during the compilation and simulation process of the `{module_name}_seq.sv` file. These errors are generated by the VCS simulator and include the line numbers and relevant modification suggestions.  

3. Modify the related code lines in the `{module_name}_seq.sv` file based on the content of `check_seq.txt`. Note that only the lines of code related to the errors need to be modified. Do not make any changes to the rest of the code to avoid introducing new errors.  

4. After making the modifications, check the entire `{module_name}_seq.sv` file to ensure that no errors of the same type as those in `check_seq.txt` occur.  

5. Common error types and their corresponding fixes:  
   a. **`inside`-related errors**: Review and correct the syntax of `inside` statements.  
   b. **`include "{module_name}_seq_item.sv"` errors**: If this error occurs, directly delete this line of code.  
   c. **`randomize() with {}` using `$urandom_range` or `$urandom`**: If this type of error occurs, do not use `$urandom_range` or `$urandom`. Instead, rewrite the code using `inside` or other methods to ensure both functional and syntactical correctness.  
   d. **`randomize() with {}` using `if...else` or `begin...end` blocks**: If this type of error occurs, do not use `if...else` or `begin...end` blocks. Rewrite the code using alternative methods while ensuring functionality and syntax correctness.  
   e. **`foreach`-related errors**: If this type of error occurs, do not use `foreach`. Rewrite the code using other methods to ensure both functionality and syntax correctness.  
   f. **`{modulename}`-related errors**: If this type of error occurs, it indicates that `{modulename}` was not replaced correctly during code generation. Replace it with the correct DUT module name based on the context.  
   g. **`constraints inconsistency failure`**: If this type of error occurs, refer to the corresponding content in `{module_name}_seq_item.sv`. Analyze the issue and provide values in the erroneous code lines of `{module_name}_seq.sv` that comply with the constraints.  

6. For error types not listed above, analyze and modify the code based on the specific content of `check_seq.txt`.  

7. Before outputting the corrected code, add a line `### Corrected Code` to indicate that the corrected code follows.
