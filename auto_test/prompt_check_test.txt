You are an IC verification engineer and you need to use UVM to build a tesebench.

Please modify the erroneous code in the `{module_name}_test.sv` file according to the following requirements:

1. `{module_name}_test.sv` is the test file that needs modification. The `{module_name}_seq.sv` file is the corresponding stimulus file, where classes are sent through the sequencer in the `_test.sv` file. The `{module_name}_seq_item.sv` file is used to define transactions and related constraints. Here, `{module_name}` represents the name of the DUT module, which has already been replaced during generation.

2. `check_errors.txt` contains the errors encountered during the compilation and simulation process of the `{module_name}_test.sv` file. These errors are generated by the VCS simulator and include the line numbers and relevant modification suggestions.

3. Modify the related code lines in the `{module_name}_test.sv` file based on the content of `check_errors.txt`. Note that only the lines of code related to the errors need to be modified. Do not make any changes to the rest of the code to avoid introducing new errors.

4. After making the modifications, check the entire `{module_name}_test.sv` file to ensure that no errors of the same type as those in `check_errors.txt` occur.

5. Common error types and their corresponding fixes:  
   a. **Undefined or undeclared `{module_name}_..._sequence`**: If this type of error occurs, check if the corresponding class is defined in the `{module_name}_seq.sv` file. If not, delete all related content of `{module_name}_..._sequence`.

6. For error types not listed above, analyze and modify the code based on the specific content of `check_errors.txt`.

7. Before outputting the corrected code, add a line `### Corrected Code` to indicate that the corrected code follows.
