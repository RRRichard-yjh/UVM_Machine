You are an IC verification engineer and you need to use UVM to build a tesebench.

Please modify the erroneous code in the `{module_name}_seq.sv` file according to the following requirements:

1. `{module_name}_seq.sv` is the stimulus file that needs to be modified, and `{module_name}_seq_item.sv` is the file used to define the transaction and related constraints. Here, `{module_name}` represents the name of the DUT module, which has already been replaced during generation.  

2. `check_errors.txt` contains the errors encountered during the compilation and simulation process of the `{module_name}_seq.sv` file. These errors are generated by the VCS simulator and include the line numbers and relevant modification suggestions.  

3. Modify the related code lines in the `{module_name}_seq.sv` file based on the content of `check_errors.txt`. 

4. Please note, when modifying, do not delete the entire class. Only modify the lines of code related to the errors, and do not make any changes to the rest of the code to avoid introducing new errors.

5. After making the modifications, check the entire `{module_name}_seq.sv` file to ensure that no errors of the same type as those in `check_errors.txt` occur.  

6. Common error types and their corresponding fixes:  
   a. **`inside`-related errors**: Review and correct the syntax of `inside` statements.
      Correct syntax examples: data inside {[8'd10:8'd100]};
                               data inside {4'd2, 4'd5, 4'd7, 4'd9};

   b. **`include "{module_name}_seq_item.sv"` errors**: If this error occurs, directly delete this line of code.  
   c. **`randomize() with {}` using `$urandom_range` or `$urandom`**: If this type of error occurs, do not use `$urandom_range` or `$urandom`. Instead, rewrite the code using `inside` or other methods to ensure both functional and syntactical correctness.  
   d. **`randomize() with {}` using `if...else` or `begin...end` blocks**: If this type of error occurs, do not use `if...else` or `begin...end` blocks. Rewrite the code using alternative methods while ensuring functionality and syntax correctness.  
   e. **`foreach`-related errors**: If this type of error occurs, do not use `foreach`. Rewrite the code using other methods to ensure both functionality and syntax correctness.  
   f. **`{modulename}`-related errors**: If this type of error occurs, it indicates that `{modulename}` was not replaced correctly during code generation. Replace it with the correct DUT module name based on the context.  
   g. **`constraints inconsistency failure`**: If this type of error occurs, refer to the corresponding content in `{module_name}_seq_item.sv`. Analyze the issue and provide values in the erroneous code lines of `{module_name}_seq.sv` that comply with the constraints.  

7. For error types not listed above, analyze and modify the code based on the specific content of `check_errors.txt`.

8. Please note that you should not only output the modified content; the unmodified parts of the original {module_name}_seq.sv should be retained. For instance, if the content in the directed_sequence class is modified, the final output should also include the complete code of the base_sequence and random_sequence classes as they were before any modifications.

9. Before outputting the code, include a line with ### Corrected Code to indicate that the specific code will follow. Only output the code for {module_name}_seq.sv, and do not output the code for {module_name}_seq_item.sv.
