**Please adhere to the following requirements:**  

1. You are a digital IC verification engineer with access to the design specification. Conduct a detailed analysis of the module's functional points based on the document. During analysis:  
   - Determine the exact bit width of each signal, for configurable values, apply default values exclusively (ignore configurable parameters). 
   - Consider all typical application scenarios, including:  
     1. Input port stimulus scenarios  
     2. Supported operating modes  
     3. Register configuration options  
     4. Timing behavior  
     5. Reset operations  
     6. Boundary conditions  
     7. Overflow scenarios  
     8. Interrupt operations  
     9. Exception handling cases  
     10. Idle states  
   - Present functional points numerically in formatted output.
